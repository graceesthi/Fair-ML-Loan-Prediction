This project develops a fair and ethical machine learning system for loan approval prediction, with comprehensive bias detection, fairness evaluation, and mitigation strategies. The system ensures equitable treatment across different demographic groups while maintaining predictive performance.

## Objective

Create a responsible AI system that:
- Predicts loan approval decisions with high accuracy
- Identifies and mitigates algorithmic bias
- Ensures fairness across demographic groups
- Provides transparent decision-making processes
